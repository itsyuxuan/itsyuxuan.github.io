## G'day, mate :)

It's Yuxuan here!

I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at the Australian National University. 

I'm also an avid photographer and traveller. 

I have captured the stunning Star Trails above the Parliament House in Canberra, the dazzling Milky Way in the middle of New South Wales, and the Aurora Australis in Tasmania. 

Such a favour encourages me to become a front-end developer, as I can pursue beauty by designing and implementing interfaces for websites and applications.
