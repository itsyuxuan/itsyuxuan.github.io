## Gâ€™day mate! How ya goin'? ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yuxuan Lin. Feel free to call me Jasper.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Australian National University in December 2022, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Sydney.

As an enthusiastic photographer and traveller, I've captured stunning star trails above the Parliament House in Canberra, the dazzling Milky Way in the heart of New South Wales, and the Aurora Australis in Tasmania.

This passion for capturing beauty has led me to pursue a career in front-end development, where I can design and implement interfaces for websites and applications.

My front-end skills include languages like JavaScript ES6, HTML, and CSS and frameworks/tools like Vue 3, Vite, Rollup, Git, and npm.
