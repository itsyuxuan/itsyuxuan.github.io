## Gâ€™day mate! How ya goin'? ðŸ‘‹

It's Yuxuan here!

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology from the Australian National University and am pursuing a Master of Information Technology degree at the University of Sydney.

As an avid photographer and traveller, I have captured the stunning Star Trails above the Parliament House in Canberra, the dazzling Milky Way in the middle of New South Wales, and the Aurora Australis in Tasmania.

Such a favour encourages me to become a front-end developer, as I can pursue beauty by designing and implementing interfaces for websites and applications.

My front-end skills include languages like JavaScript, ECMAScript 6, HTML, and CSS and frameworks/tools like Vue 3, Vite, Rollup, Git, and npm.
